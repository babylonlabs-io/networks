# Babylon Networks

Welcome to the network page for the Babylon Phase-2 testnet (`bbn-test-5`).
This is your central hub 
for network participation information, whether you're running a node, 
operating as a validator, providing finality services, or participating 
in the covenant committee.

## Network Parameters

<!-- TODO: sync with devops on the things we should add here.

* Chain ID
* Genesis file location
* Seed nodes
* RPC nodes
* Snapshot

We can fully link to our partners here.
