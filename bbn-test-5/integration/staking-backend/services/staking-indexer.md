Staking Indexer

The staking indexer is a tool that extracts BTC stakingâ€“relevant data from the Bitcoin blockchain, ensures that it follows the prerequisites for a valid staking transaction, and determines whether the stake should be active or not.

All valid staking transactions are transformed into a structured form, stored in a database, and published as events in a RabbitMQ messaging queue for consumption by consumers.

The staking indexer is the enforcer of the Bitcoin Staking protocol and serves as the ground truth for the lock-only Bitcoin Staking system.

1. Hardware Requirements

   - CPU: Multi-core processor (4 cores minimum)
   - Memory: Minimum 4GB RAM, recommended 8GB RAM

2. Install Staking Indexer

   2.1. Clone the repository to your local machine from Github:
   
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/staking-indexer.git
    ```

   2.2. Check out the desired version:
   
    You can find the latest release [here](https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/staking-indexer/releases).
       
    ```bash
    cd staking-indexer
    git checkout tags/{VERSION}
    ```

   2.3. Install the sid daemon binary by running:
   
    ```bash
    make install
    ```

3. Configuration

   3.1. Generate the default configuration:
   
    ```bash
    sid init
    ```

    This will create a sid.conf file in the default home directory. The default home directories for different operating systems are:
       
    - MacOS: `~/Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/Sid`
    - Linux: `~/.Sid`
    - Windows: `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Sid`

   3.2. Update default configurations

    Bitcoin network to run on:
    Set the `BitcoinNetwork` to match with the information from the [installed Bitcoin node](https://docs.babylonlabs.io/docs/user-guides/bitcoin-staking-phase1/backend-deployment/infra/bitcoind).
    
    ```bash
    [Application Options]
    ; Bitcoin network to run on
    BitcoinNetwork = signet
    ```

    Bitcoin node to connect to:
    Set the Bitcoin node connection address (`RPCHost`) and credentials (`RPCUser` and `RPCUser`) to match the information from the installed Bitcoin node.
    
    ```bash
    [btcconfig]
    ; The daemon's rpc listening address.
    RPCHost = 127.0.0.1:38332
    
    ; Username for RPC connections.
    RPCUser = user
    
    ; Password for RPC connections.
    RPCPass = pass
    ```

    RabbitMQ cluster to connect to:
    Set the RabbitMQ connection address (`Url`) and credentials (`User` and `Password`) to match the information from the installed RabbitMQ cluster.
    
    ```bash
    [queueconfig]
    ; the user name of the queue
    User = user
    
    ; the password of the queue
    Password = password
    
    ; the url of the queue
    Url = localhost:5672
    ```

    Prometheus metrics configuration:
    Set the `Host` and `Port` to customize how the metrics are exposed.
    
    ```bash
    [metricsconfig]
    ; IP of the Prometheus server
    Host = 127.0.0.1
    
    ; Port of the Prometheus server
    Port = 2112
    ```

4. Start Staking Indexer

   In case you are using the default home directory, you can start the staking-indexer running:
   
    ```bash
    sid start
    ```

   Note: If the indexer fails to start due to re-org, please rerun the command to start it.

5. Create systemd service (Optional - Linux Only)

   5.1. Create systemd service definition:
    Run the following command, replacing system_username with the appropriate system user or service account name:
    
    ```bash
    cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/sid.service
    [Unit]
    Description=Sid service
    After=network.target
    
    [Service]
    Type=simple
    ExecStart=$(which sid) start
    Restart=on-failure
    User=system_username
    
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    EOF
    ```

   5.2. Reload systemd manager configuration:
       
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    ```

   5.3. Enable the service to start on boot:
       
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable sid.service
    ```

   5.4. Start the service:
       
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start sid.service
    ```

   5.5. Verify Staking Indexer is running:
    Check sid service status:
    
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status sid
    ```

    Expected log:
    
    ```bash
    Jul 04 06:49:54 system_username sid[839944]: 2024-07-04T06:49:55.798273Z        info        Starting Prometheus server        {"address": "127.0.0.1:2114"}
    Jul 04 06:49:54 system_username sid[839944]: 2024-07-04T06:49:55.805957Z        info        Starting Staking Indexer App        {"module": "staking indexer"}
    ```

6. Monitoring

   The service exposes Prometheus metrics through a Prometheus server. By default, the server is reachable at `127.0.0.1:2112`.
