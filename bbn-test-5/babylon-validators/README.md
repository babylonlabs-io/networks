## 1. Prerequisites

Before setting up a validator, you'll need:
1. A fully synced Babylon node. For node setup instructions, see our 
[Node Setup Guide](../babylon-node/README.md)
2. Sufficient BBN tokens. For instructions on obtaining BBN tokens, see the 
[Get Funds section](../babylon-node/README.md#get-funds) in the Node Setup Guide.

## 2. System Requirements

Recommended specifications for running a Babylon validator node:
<!-- TODO: RPC Nodes more ram is required add when we have completed node load test  -->
- CPU: Quad Core AMD/Intel (amd64)
- RAM: 32GB
- Storage: 2TB NVMe
- Network: 100MBps bidirectional
- Encrypted storage for keys and sensitive data
- Regular system backups (hourly, daily, weekly)
- DDoS protection

These are reference specifications for a production validator. 
Requirements may vary based on network activity and your operational needs.

## 3. Key Management
### 3.1 Keys for a CometBFT validator

The validator key is a fundamental component of your validator's identity 
within the Babylon network. This cryptographic key-pair serves multiple critical 
functions: it signs blocks during the consensus process, validates transactions, 
and manages your validator's operations on the network. Creating and securing this 
key is one of the most important steps in setting up your validator.

We will be using [Cosmos SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.52/user/run-node/keyring) 
backends for key storage, which offer support for the following 
keyrings:

- `test` is a password-less keyring and is unencrypted on disk.
- `os` uses the system's secure keyring and will prompt for a passphrase at startup.
- `file` encrypts the keyring with a passphrase and stores it on disk.

To generate your validator key, use the following command:

```shell
babylond keys add <name> --home <path> --keyring-backend <keyring-backend>
```

Parameters:
The `<name>` specifies a unique identifier for the key.
- `--home` specifies the directory where your node files will be stored 
  (e.g. `--home ./nodeDir`)
- `--keyring-backend` specifies the keyring backend to use, can be `test`, `file`, 
or `os`.

The execution result displays the address of the newly generated key and its 
public key. Following is a sample output for the command:

```shell
- address: bbn1kvajzzn6gtfn2x6ujfvd6q54etzxnqg7pkylk9
  name: <name>
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey",
           key: "Ayau+8f945c1iQp9tfTVaCT5lzhD8n4MRkZNqpoL6Tpo"}'
  type: local
```

> **Security Tip üîí**: Make sure to securely store this information, particularly 
> your address and private key details. Losing access to these credentials would 
> mean losing control of your validator and any staked funds.

#### 3.1.1 Get Funds
<!-- TODO: we do not need the below section. We can just mention
that the reader can source funds through the faucet
when we ask them to submit a transactoin (later) -->

Funds are necessary to interact with the Babylon network and run a validator. 
There are a few actions that require funds:
1. Pay for transaction fees (gas)
2. Send transactions
3. Participate in network activities

You can obtain testnet tokens through two methods:
1. Request funds from the Babylon Testnet Faucet 
[here](#tbd) 
<!-- add link to faucet -->
2. Join our Discord server and visit the `#faucet` channel: 
[Discord Server](https://discord.com/channels/1046686458070700112/1075371070493831259)

> ‚ö° **Important**: These are testnet tokens with no real value, used only for 
> testing and development purposes.

### 3.2 Keys for a BLS Voting
#### 3.2.1 What is BLS Voting

Babylon validators are required to participate in
[BLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLS_digital_signature) voting
at the end of each epoch.
The Babylon blockchain defines epochs as a fixed period
within the blockchain, defined or set by a number of blocks,
during which the validator set remains consistent. 
At the end of the epoch,
the validator BLS signatures are aggregated to create a compact checkpoint
that is timestamped on the Bitcoin ledger.
The BLS voting mechanism achieves a significant reduction in the cost of
checkpoints, while the epoching mechanism specifies a defined frequency
for checkpointing in the Bitcoin blockchain.

#### 3.2.2 Create BLS Key

To generate your BLS key, you'll need to use your validator address from the 
previous step. 

Run this command:

```shell
babylond create-bls-key <address>
```

Replace `<address>` with your address from the earlier keyring 
generation (it should look similar to `bbn1kvajzzn6gtfn2x6ujfvd6q54etzxnqg7pkylk9`). 

The above command will:
1. Generate a new BLS key pair
2. Associate it with your validator address
3. Store it in your node's configuration file at 
`~/.<path>/config/priv_validator_key.json`

This key will be used automatically by your validator software when it needs 
to participate in epoch-end signature collection. The BLS signatures help 
create compact, efficient proofs of consensus that can be later timestamped to Bitcoin.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: The `priv_validator_key.json` file contains sensitive key 
> material. Make sure to backup this file and store it securely, as it's 
> essential for your validator's operation and cannot be recovered if lost.

## 4. CometBFT Validator Configuration

Next, we need to request the bls public key in order to create the validator 
configuration file.

```shell
babylond tendermint show-validator --home <home>
```

It will output a public key in the following format:

```shell
{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.ed25519.PubKey","key":"0Wlt7ZPl0uvv7onsw4gP8FSQJUk986zMcOdWselDPM4="}
```

Use the output of the command above and replace the `pubkey` value in the example below. 
Then subsequently run the following command to create the validator configuration file:

```shell
cat > <home>/config/validator.json << EOF
{
  "pubkey": {"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.ed25519.PubKey","key":"0Wlt7ZPl0uvv7onsw4gP8FSQJUk986zMcOdWselDPM4="},
  "amount": "1000000ubbn",
  "moniker": "my-validator",
  "commission-rate": "0.10",
  "commission-max-rate": "0.20",
  "commission-max-change-rate": "0.01",
  "min-self-delegation": "1"
}
EOF
```

Parameters:
- `pubkey`: Your validator's public key
- `amount`: Initial self-delegation amount
- `moniker`: Your validator's name/identifier
- `commission-rate`: Current commission rate 
- `commission-max-rate`: Maximum commission rate allowed
- `commission-max-change-rate`: Maximum daily commission change rate
- `min-self-delegation`: Minimum amount you must keep self-delegated

If you prefer to add this manually or are having issues, another option is to 
create a `validator.json` file and then paste the above json into it but remember
to replace the `pubkey` value with your actual validator public key.

## 5. Creating a Validator

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: You will need a funded account for this step

Unlike traditional Cosmos SDK chains that use the `staking` module, 
Babylon uses the [`checkpointing`](https://docs.babylonlabs.io/docs/developer-guides/modules/checkpointing) module for validator creation and management.

The creation process requires your previously generated BLS key, 
which should be located at `<path>/config/priv_validator_key.json`, 
where `<path>` is the `--home` directory you specified when setting up your node.

To create your validator, run the following command:

```shell 
babylond tx checkpointing create-validator \
    ./<home-path>/config/validator.json \
    --chain-id bbn-test-5 \
    --gas "auto" \
    --gas-adjustment 1.5 \
    --gas-prices "0.005ubbn" \
    --from <your-key-name>
    --keyring-backend <keyring-backend>
```

Parameters:
- `--chain-id`: The network identifier
- `--gas`: Set to "auto" to automatically calculate the gas needed
- `--gas-adjustment`: A multiplier for the estimated gas 
- `--gas-prices`: Transaction fee in ubbn per unit of gas
- `--from`: Your key name or address that will sign and pay for this transaction

Upon successful creation, you'll be asked to approve the transaction. 
Once approved, you'll receive a transaction hash and your validator
operator address 
(e.g., `bbnvaloper1qh8444k43spt6m8ernm8phxr332k85teavxmuq`).

### 5.1 Verifying Validator Setup

To verify your validator setup, you can use the following steps:

First, get your validator's operator address using your Babylon address: 

```shell
babylond keys show <your-key-name> --address --bech val --home <path> --keyring-backend <keyring-backend>
```

For example, for the address we used above is `bbn1qh8444k43spt6m8ernm8phxr332k85teavxmuq`, 
the operator address is `bbnvaloper1qh8444k43spt6m8ernm8phxr332k85teavxmuq`. 

Next, inspect your validator's details: 

```shell 
babylond query staking validator <validator-operator-address>
```

The output should return the selected validator's configuration.

```yaml 
validator:
  commission:
    rates:
      current: "100000000000000000" 
      max: "1000000000000000000" 
      max_change: "10000000000000000"
  description:
    moniker: "my-validator" 
    website: "https://myweb.site" 
    security_contact: "my-validator0@gmail.com"
  status: 1 
  tokens: "100"
```

Usually when first creating a validator, the immediate status will be 
`BOND_STATUS_UNBONDED`. To see your validators status change you will need to 
wait for the epoch to end.

```shell 
babylond query staking validators
```

### 5.2 Understanding Validator Status

Your validator enters the active set based on two conditions: 
1. The completion of the current epoch (a network-wide time period for 
coordinating activities) 
2. Having sufficient stake to qualify for the active set.

When active, your status will show as `BOND_STATUS_BONDED`.

The other status codes are:

```shell
BOND_STATUS_UNSPECIFIED = 0
BOND_STATUS_UNBONDED = 1
BOND_STATUS_UNBONDING = 2
BOND_STATUS_BONDED = 3
```

### 5.3 Managing Your Validator

For delegation operations (`delegate`, `redelegate`, `unbond`, `cancel-unbond`),
you must use the wrapped messages in the `epoching` modules.
This is because standard staking module messages are disabled in Babylon.

For detailed information about these operations, visit our
<!-- TODO: let's point to the github docs on github guides -->
[documentation](https://docs.babylonlabs.io/docs/developer-guides/modules/epoching#delaying-wrapped-messages-to-the-end-of-epochs).

## 6. Advanced Security Architecture

We suggest using additional security measures to protect your validator. The best 
option is to implement a 
<!-- TODO: there's no such docs. Do we need to outline this setup
in this guide or can we guide to external maintained guides?
We have a typical cosmos sdk setup after all. -->
[Sentry Node Architecture](https://docs.babylonlabs.io/docs/validator-guides/advanced-security-architecture#sentry-node-architecture).

This involves deploying sentry nodes as a protective layer around your 
validator node. The sentry nodes act as a buffer between your validator and the 
public network, with a private network maintained between your validator and its 
sentry nodes. 

This robust security architecture helps protect your validator from DDoS attacks 
and other network-level threats by ensuring your validator only communicates 
with trusted sentry nodes rather than directly with the public network.

## 7. Conclusion

Congratulations! Your validator is now part of the Babylon network. Remember to
monitor your validator's performance and maintain good uptime to avoid
penalties.
