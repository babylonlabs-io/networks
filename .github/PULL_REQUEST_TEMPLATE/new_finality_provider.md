# New ${nickname} Finality Provider

## Checklist

- [ ] I have followed the finality provider information registry
[guide](https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/networks/blob/main/bbn-1/finality-providers/README.md)
- [ ] I have backed up my mnemonic
- [ ] I have read and agree to the [Babylon Ecosystem Participant License](https://docs.babylonlabs.io/assets/files/babylon-ecosystem-participant-license.pdf) and the [Babylon Ecosystem Participant Agreement](https://docs.babylonlabs.io/assets/files/babylon-ecosystem-participant-agreement.pdf).

> [!CAUTION]
> The loss of the (generated keys + mnemonic) makes the finality provider
useless and unable to provide finality, which would lead to no transition to
later phases of the Babylon network.
